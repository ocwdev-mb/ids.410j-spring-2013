## Course Overview

This page focuses on the course _IDS.410J Modeling and Assessment for Policy_ as it was taught by Prof. Noelle Selin in Spring 2013.

_Modeling and Assessment for Policy_ is a graduate course that introduces students to tools and strategies for technically-focused policy analysis. The course is cross-listed with the Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences, and draws examples from modeling of earth and environmental systems.

## Course Outcomes

### Course Goals for Students

- Understand and apply tools and techniques used for technically-focused policy analysis
- Identify best practices and limitations in using quantitative models for policy
- Evaluate the effectiveness of scientific and technical advice in policy-making processes
- Describe and analyze strategies to manage scientific and technical advice processes
- Communicate technical results to policy audiences

### Possibilities for Further Study/Careers

- Ongoing research in areas of modeling e.g. science, engineering, economics
- Careers in interpreting scientific results for decision-making
